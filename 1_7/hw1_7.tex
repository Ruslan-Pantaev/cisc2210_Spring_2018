\subsection*{1.}
\begin{center}
Let $S = \{1,2,3,4,5\} \text{ and } T = \{a,b,c,d\}$. For each question below: if the answer is Yes, give an example, else explain briefly.\\

\textit{onto: every element in codomain is accounted for}\\
\textit{one-to-one: every element in domain has a unique spot in codomain}\\
\textit{one-to-one correspondence: one-to-one between domain-codomain and codomain-domain}
\end{center}

\subsection*{(a)}
\begin{center}
Are there any one-to-one functions from $S$ into $T$?\\
\hfill \break
No, this would be an onto function but doesn't meet the requirements for one-to-one.
\end{center}

\subsection*{(b)}
\begin{center}
Are there any one-to-one functions from $T$ into $S$?\\
\hfill \break
Yes. One element in $S$ will be unused.
\end{center}

\subsection*{(c)}
\begin{center}
Are there any functions mapping $S$ onto $T$?\\
\hfill \break
Yes. Some two elements from $S$ will map onto some single element in $T$.
\end{center}

\subsection*{(d)}
\begin{center}
Are there any functions mapping $T$ onto $S$?\\
\hfill \break
No, not enough elements in $T$ to fill up codomain $S$. This could be a one-to-one however.
\end{center}

\subsection*{(e)}
\begin{center}
Are there any one-to-one correspondences between $S$ and $T$?\\
\hfill \break
No, $S$ and $T$ have different number of elements.
\end{center}

\subsection*{2.}
\begin{center}
The functions sketched in Figure 3 have domain and codomain both equal to $[0,1]$\\

\textit{(TODO check with Professor about question 2)}
\end{center}

\subsection*{(a)}
\begin{center}
Which of these functions are one-to-one?\\
\hfill \break
$f_1, f_2, f_{11}$ because $x$ and $y$ coordinates are not repeated on $x$ and $y$ axes.
\end{center}

\hfill \break
\subsection*{(b)}
\begin{center}
Which of these functions map $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$?\\
\hfill \break
Might be a bit of a trick question; the original statement tells us that all functions have domain and codomain mapped to $[0,1]$.
\end{center}

\subsection*{(c)}
\begin{center}
Which of these functions are one-to-one correspondences?\\
\hfill \break
$f_{12}$ because the graph is symmetrical diagonally with no repeated points on $x$ and $y$ axes.
